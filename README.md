## 🔍 How Array Concept is Used

* `todos` array stores all tasks as objects: `{ id, text, priority, completed, createdAt }`
* `push()` — add new tasks
* `filter()` — delete or filter tasks
* `find()` — toggle task completion
* `sort()` — order tasks by completion and priority
* `.length` and `.filter()` — stats calculation

The array is the core structure for managing all task data.
